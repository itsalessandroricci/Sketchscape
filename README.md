# Sketchscape

Embark on a captivating journey in "Sketchscape", where the boundaries between Light and Darkness blur, and an angel's destiny hangs in the balance. As the story unfolds, immerse yourself in the tale of an angel torn between two realms: the alluring Darkness and the steadfast Light.

Once a devoted member of the Light, our protagonist finds himself drawn to the enigmatic allure of the Darkness. Despite the Light's persistent hold, he yearns to break free from its constraints. Determined to forge his own path, the angel must navigate through a myriad of obstacles that stand between him and his newfound freedom.

In this endless runner adventure, players must guide the angel through treacherous terrain and formidable challenges. With each tap, the angel can execute graceful maneuvers to overcome obstacles. A single tap propels him into a small jump, while a double tap unleashes a higher, more daring leap â€“ but beware, for this ability is only accessible when empowered by a special item.

As the angel ventures deeper into the realm of Darkness, questions linger: Will the Darkness offer solace and aid his quest for liberation? Can he defy the odds and carve out his own happy ending amidst the turmoil? The answers lie within the heart-pounding journey of "Sketchscape". Will you embrace the shadows and guide the angel to his destiny?
